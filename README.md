# Autonomous Dryvacuum Cleaner for Enriched Uranium

## Description
This is the repository holding the catkin workspace to our ROS-controlled robot being developed for Senior Design 2 at FIU, Fall 2021. 

## Probem Statement
The team designed the autonomous dry-vacuum cleaner to navigate through facilities and effectively collect any debris in its path. This device will identify
any debris and safely pick it up without user intervention. The device will be easy to maintain, will avoid  obstacles, and will not have any wireless 
communication technology.
